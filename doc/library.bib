@article{Furukawa2010,
abstract = {This paper proposes a novel algorithm for multiview stereopsis that outputs a dense set of small rectangular patches covering the surfaces visible in the images. Stereopsis is implemented as a match, expand, and filter procedure, starting from a sparse set of matched keypoints, and repeatedly expanding these before using visibility constraints to filter away false matches. The keys to the performance of the proposed algorithm are effective techniques for enforcing local photometric consistency and global visibility constraints. Simple but effective methods are also proposed to turn the resulting patch model into a mesh which can be further refined by an algorithm that enforces both photometric consistency and regularization constraints. The proposed approach automatically detects and discards outliers and obstacles and does not require any initialization in the form of a visual hull, a bounding box, or valid depth ranges. We have tested our algorithm on various data sets including objects with fine surface details, deep concavities, and thin structures, outdoor scenes observed from a restricted set of viewpoints, and "crowded" scenes where moving obstacles appear in front of a static structure of interest. A quantitative evaluation on the Middlebury benchmark shows that the proposed method outperforms all others submitted so far for four out of the six data sets.},

@article{Smith2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a new Bayesian framework for motion segmentation--dividing a frame from an image sequence into layers representing different moving objects--by tracking edges between frames. Edges are found using the Canny edge detector, and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is then used to fit motion models to these edges and also to calculate the probabilities of the edges obeying each motion model. The edges are also used to segment the image into regions of similar color. The most likely labeling for these regions is then calculated by using the edge probabilities, in association with a Markov Random Field-style prior. The identification of the relative depth ordering of the different motion layers is also determined, as an integral part of the process. An efficient implementation of this framework is presented for segmenting two motions (foreground and background) using two frames. It is then demonstrated how, by tracking the edges into further frames, the probabilities may be accumulated to provide an even more accurate and robust estimate, and segment an entire sequence. Further extensions are then presented to address the segmentation of more than two motions. Here, a hierarchical method of initializing the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is described, and it is demonstrated that the Minimum Description Length principle may be used to automatically select the best number of motion layers. The results from over 30 sequences (demonstrating both two and three motions) are presented and discussed.},
