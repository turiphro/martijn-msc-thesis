Project Title:
  Constructing the concave hull of an outdoor scene (object)
  using visibility traces of points and edges

Brief Outline of Aims:
  Space carving is a technique that uses silhouettes of a single object in
  multiple photos (taken at known locations) to construct the convex hull
  in which the object is supposed to be. The method, however, has some
  limitations.
  The aim of the project is to include tracking the visibility of points of
  interest and (possibly) edges in a series of images to construct a _concave_
  hull (hollowed inwards). The developed algorithm will be tested on buildings
  in outdoor environments. As a second step, buildings can be tried to be
  projected in footage of another environment using the 3D model and textures
  acquired from the set of images.
